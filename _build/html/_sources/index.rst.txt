**InfoScan** is a software used to identify new long non-coding RNAs from single cell data and explore their characteristics in different cell populations; In addition, we can obtain new long non-coding RNA specific to the cell population, and study its function through co-expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.

The flow chart below depicts the different tool modules that are currently available.
